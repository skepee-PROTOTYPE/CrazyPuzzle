        <h2>🎮 Gameplay Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">How do I play CrazyPuzzle?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                Click on tiles to reveal their patterns, then click another tile to find its match. If the two tiles match, they disappear. If they don't match, they flip back. Continue until you've cleared the entire board. The faster you complete it, the higher your rank on the leaderboard! For detailed instructions, check our <a href="how-to-play.html" style="color: #667eea;">How to Play guide</a>.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">What's the difference between Easy, Medium, and Hard modes?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <strong>Easy:</strong> 4×4 grid with 8 pairs (16 tiles total) - great for beginners<br>
                <strong>Medium:</strong> 6×6 grid with 18 pairs (36 tiles total) - balanced challenge<br>
                <strong>Hard:</strong> 8×8 grid with 32 pairs (64 tiles total) - expert level difficulty
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Is there a time limit?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                There's no strict time limit that ends your game, but your completion time is tracked and determines your leaderboard position. Faster times result in higher rankings. You can take as long as you need to complete a puzzle.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Can I pause the game?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                Yes! In single-player mode, press ESC or click the menu button to pause. Your timer will stop while paused. Note that multiplayer games cannot be paused since they involve real-time competition with other players.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">How is my score calculated?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                Your score is primarily based on completion time (faster = better). The difficulty level acts as a multiplier, so a Hard mode completion ranks higher than an Easy mode completion with the same time. Match accuracy also contributes a small bonus to your score.
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>👥 Multiplayer Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">How does multiplayer mode work?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                Multiplayer allows you to compete against 2-4 players in real-time. All players get the same board configuration. The first player to completely clear their board wins. You can create a private room for friends or join public rooms for quick matches.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">How do I play with friends?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                Click "Multiplayer" → "Create Room" → Choose your difficulty level → Share the room code with your friends → They join using "Join Room" and entering your code → When everyone's ready, the host starts the game.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">What happens if I disconnect during a multiplayer game?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                If you disconnect, you have 30 seconds to reconnect and resume your game. After 30 seconds, you'll automatically forfeit the match. Make sure you have a stable internet connection before starting multiplayer games!
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Can I chat with other players?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                Currently, there's no built-in chat feature to keep the game focused and family-friendly. You can use external communication tools like Discord, Facebook Messenger, or phone calls to coordinate with friends while playing.
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>👤 Account & Progress</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Do I need to create an account to play?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                No! You can play as a guest without signing in. However, signing in with Google is recommended because it saves your scores, tracks your progress across devices, and allows you to appear on the global leaderboard.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">How do I save my progress?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                Click the "Sign in with Google" button. Once signed in, all your scores, stats, and achievements are automatically saved to the cloud. You can then access your progress from any device by signing in with the same Google account.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Can I play on multiple devices?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                Yes! As long as you're signed in with your Google account, your progress syncs across all devices. Play on your phone during commute, then switch to your computer at home without losing any progress.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">How do I delete my account and data?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                Visit our <a href="data-deletion.html" style="color: #667eea;">Data Deletion page</a> for instructions. You can request complete deletion of all your personal data, including scores, profile information, and game history. We'll process your request within 30 days.
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>🏆 Leaderboards & Rankings</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">How do I get on the leaderboard?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                Sign in with your Google account and complete at least one game. Your best time for each difficulty level will automatically appear on the corresponding leaderboard. Keep playing to improve your times and climb the rankings!
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">How often do leaderboards update?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                Leaderboards update in real-time! As soon as you complete a game with a better time than your previous record, it's instantly reflected on the leaderboard. You'll see your new ranking within seconds.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Are there separate leaderboards for each difficulty?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                Yes! There's a dedicated leaderboard for Easy, Medium, and Hard modes. This ensures fair competition—Easy mode players compete with Easy mode times, Hard mode players compete with Hard mode times, etc.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Do leaderboards reset?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                The main leaderboards reset monthly to give everyone a fresh chance to reach the top. Your all-time best scores are still tracked in your personal profile. Monthly resets keep the competition exciting and give new players opportunities to rank high.

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Does CrazyPuzzle work on mobile devices?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                Yes! CrazyPuzzle is fully responsive and works perfectly on smartphones and tablets (iOS and Android). You can even install it as a Progressive Web App (PWA) for an app-like experience. Just visit the site in your mobile browser and look for the "Add to Home Screen" option.

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Can I play offline?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                Single-player mode can be played offline once you've loaded the game at least once (thanks to PWA technology). However, multiplayer mode, leaderboards, and score syncing require an active internet connection.
