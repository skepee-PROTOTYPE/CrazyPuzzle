# 🎯 GOOGLE ADSENSE APPROVAL GUIDE FOR CRAZYPUZZLE

## ❌ WHY YOU WERE REJECTED

Google AdSense rejected your site due to **"Low Value Content"**. This is one of the most common rejection reasons for gaming sites. Here's what it means:

### The Problem:
- **Minimal Text Content**: Your site is primarily interactive (the game) with very little written content
- **No Information Pages**: Missing About, How to Play, FAQ, Contact pages
- **Thin Content**: No blog, articles, or guides
- **New Domain**: Site appears too new without established authority
- **Limited Pages**: Only the game and basic privacy policy

### What Google Wants:
Google AdSense requires sites to provide **substantial value** to visitors through:
- ✅ High-quality, original written content (500+ words per page)
- ✅ Multiple informative pages (minimum 10-15 pages recommended)
- ✅ Regular content updates (blog/news section)
- ✅ Clear navigation and professional design
- ✅ Established traffic and authority
- ✅ Unique, helpful information that can't be found elsewhere
